# Ethereum Voting app

Very good introduction to Ethereum https://medium.com/@mvmurthy/ethereum-for-web-developers-890be23d1d0c

# Notes

- Use a `package.json` file to specify the version of web3 to be used. The newer version `1.0.0+` does not work with the code outlined in the tutorial. Use web3 `0.20.0`.
- Add the code to an `app.js` file and run using `node app.js` to deploy the contract to your local testrpc Ethereum network.
